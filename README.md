# Quantum-Based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using Qiskit

## Project Overview

This project implements an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using quantum computing principles with Qiskit. The system leverages quantum feature encoding and classification techniques to detect potential cyber threats and anomalies in network traffic.

## Features

- Quantum-based anomaly detection using Qiskit
- Feature encoding with quantum circuits
- Quantum classifier for intrusion detection
- Integration with classical preprocessing methods

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install qiskit numpy pandas scikit-learn
   ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset and preprocess it.
2. Run the main script to perform quantum feature encoding and intrusion detection:
   ```bash
   python quantum_ids.py
   ```
3. Analyze the results for potential threats and anomalies.

## How It Works

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Extracts features from network traffic.
2. **Quantum Feature Encoding**: Converts classical data into quantum states.
3. **Quantum Classification**: Applies quantum algorithms for anomaly detection.
4. **Analysis**: Evaluates results and identifies potential intrusions.
